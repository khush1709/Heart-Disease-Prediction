# Heart Disease Prediction

This repository contains a Python script for predicting heart disease using the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The script includes data preprocessing, outlier removal, feature scaling, model training using Logistic Regression, and evaluation of the model's performance.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset, which contains various attributes such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, and electrocardiographic measurements, along with the target variable indicating the presence of heart disease.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Files
- `Logistic_regression.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.


## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `Logistic_regression.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Run the cells sequentially to execute the code.
4. Explore the results and analysis provided in the notebook.
